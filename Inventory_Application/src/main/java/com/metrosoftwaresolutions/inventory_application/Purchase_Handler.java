    //find the existing Product name in inventory and subtract from to the quantity
    //Thread.sleep(3000); at the bottom of the loop for idk 3 or so seconds

    //make sure the inventory level will not drop below 0, don't have to code this yet just be smart about what subtracting
    //keep JSON persistence in mind for the next time this runs, don't subtract below 0 in the future (subtract small amounts from large quantities)
